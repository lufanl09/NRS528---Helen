## Hello!

### Who Am I?

Hi Everyone! My name is Helen Liu. I'm a third-year PhD student at the University of Rhode Island. I'm currently studying Environmental and Natural Resource Economics, which I also received my Master's degree in in 2022. I have always been interested in environmental issues, so for my undergraduate degree, I decided to study Environmental Analysis and Policy. 

### Where am I from?

I was born in Beijing, China, and moved to Bangkok, Thailand, when I was 9. After graduating high school, I moved to Boston to attend Boston University for my undergad. After living in Boston for 7 years, I have now moved to Rhode Island to pursue my PhD degree.

_This is one of my favorite Thai dishes, fried morning glory! It's really delicious and a staple in Thailand!_

### Research Interests

My main research interest in renewable energy, and more specifically, repurposed electric vehicle batteries. For my master's paper, I performed a discrete choice model in the broader United States to get a better understanding of consumer preferences for new vs. repurposed batteries for residential energy storage. I believe that by repurposing EV batteries, we can at least prolong the amount of waste entering the environment for a longer period of time. 

### Hobbies 

During my free time, I like to:
- Read
- Watch movies
- Explore different cuisines 
- Collect Pokemon cards
