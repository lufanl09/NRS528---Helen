# NRS 528 Semester Final Project

### In your final assignment for this course, you should create a Python Toolbox that contains a minimum of three simple
### tools for undertaking geoprocessing and file management operations. These tools can be discrete or part of a larger
### workflow. However, the caveats are that you should create a "single file" toolbox (no includes, or external file
### tools) and you should aim to not exceed 2000 lines of code in its entirety (but if you do, no worries).
### You should document the toolbox using Github README.md and provide example data for running each of your tools.

## Grading and feedback will focus on:
    ### 1) Does the toolbox install, and the tools run successfully?
    ### 2) Cleanliness of code
    ### 3) Functionality and depth of processing operation
    ### 4) Appropriate use of documentation
    ### 5) Provide example data that allows me to test your tools.

## The criteria are:
    ### Does the toolbox install and run? (25 points)
    ### Cleanliness of code (25 points)
    ### Functionality and depth of processing (25 points)
    ### Appropriate use of documentation (15 points)
    ### In addition, you must provide example data (10 points).

### The goal of this project is to create a toolbox that can perform analysis to identify suitable locations for a
### a wind farm. The main geoprocessing tools that will be used to create the toolbox are: Select, Clip, and Buffer.
### The main data used to test this toolbox are the Rhode Island Towns shapefile and the Rhode Island land cover types
### shapefile.
